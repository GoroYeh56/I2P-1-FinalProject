# Final Project of Introduction to Programming (I)

This is a 2D space shooting game. \
The player can control the spacecraft to move in four directions using the up/down/left/right keyboards.\
Your goal is to shoot the enemies using ' whitespace ' keyboard.\
Note that your type language should be __English__ .\
You can also press the 'setting' button in the right-upper corner in the menu scene to switch the game mode to 2-players mode.

## How to download and play the game

Due to the memory limit (100MB) of Github, I'm sorry that I cannot give you the .zip file.\
My suggestion is that you can clone the whole repository, and access the game through the following steps : \
Just click the Final_demo.exe to play the game.\
Note the the .exe files should be in the folder that includes all resourses (including images, audios, fonts,...etc.).
If there are missing files, you might get error messages and cannot play the game.
